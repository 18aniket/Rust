Why Rust ?
The Rust language makes you a simple promise: if your program passes the compiler’s checks, it is free of undefined behavior. 
Dangling pointers, double-frees, and null pointer dereferences are all caught at compile time. Array references are secured with a mix of compile-time and run-time checks ,so there are no buffer overruns: the Rust equivalent of our unfortunate C program exits safely with an error message.

3 major reasons:-
Parallel Programming Is Tamed
And Yet Rust Is Still Fast
Rust Makes Collaboration Easier

Install Rust on your computer:-
The best way to install Rust is to use rustup. Go to https://rustup.rs and follow the instructions there.
We prefer rustup because it’s a tool for managing Rust installations, like RVM for Ruby or NVM for Node. For example, when a new version of Rust is released, you’ll be able to upgrade with zero clicks by typing rustup update.
