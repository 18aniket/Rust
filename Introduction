Why Rust ?
The Rust language makes you a simple promise: if your program passes the compilerâ€™s checks, it is free of undefined behavior. 
Dangling pointers, double-frees, and null pointer dereferences are all caught at compile time. Array references are secured with a mix of compile-time and run-time checks ,so there are no buffer overruns: the Rust equivalent of our unfortunate C program exits safely with an error message.

3 major reasons:-
Parallel Programming Is Tamed
And Yet Rust Is Still Fast
Rust Makes Collaboration Easier
