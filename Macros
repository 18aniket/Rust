Rust supports macros, a way to extend the language in ways that go beyond what you can do with functions alone. 
For example, we’ve seen the assert_eq! macro, which is handy for tests:

assert_eq!(gcd(6, 10), 2);
This could have been written as a generic function, but the assert_eq! macro does several things that functions can’t do. 
One is that when an assertion fails, assert_eq! generates an error message containing the filename and line number of the assertion. 
Functions have no way of getting that information. Macros can, because the way they work is completely different.

Macros are a kind of shorthand. During compilation, before types are checked and long before any machine code is generated, 
each macro call is expanded—that is, it’s replaced with some Rust code. The preceding macro call expands to something roughly like this:

match (&gcd(6, 10), &2) {
    (left_val, right_val) => {
        if !(*left_val == *right_val) {
            panic!("assertion failed: `(left == right)`, \
                    (left: `{:?}`, right: `{:?}`)", left_val, right_val);
        }
    }


panic! is also a macro, which itself expands to yet more Rust code (not shown here). 
That code uses two other macros, file!() and line!(). 
Once every macro call in the crate is fully expanded, Rust moves on to the next phase of compilation.

At run time, an assertion failure would look like this (and would indicate a bug in the gcd() function, since 2 is the correct answer):

thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`, (left: `17`,
right: `2`)', gcd.rs:7

Macro calls are always marked with an exclamation point, so they stand out when you’re reading code, 
and they can’t be called accidentally when you meant to call a function. 
Rust macros never insert unmatched brackets or parentheses. And Rust macros come with pattern matching, 
making it easier to write macros that are both maintainable and appealing to use.

Macro calls are always marked with an exclamation point, so they stand out when you’re reading code, 
and they can’t be called accidentally when you meant to call a function. Rust macros never insert unmatched brackets or parentheses. 
And Rust macros come with pattern matching, making it easier to write macros that are both maintainable and appealing to use.

A macro defined with macro_rules! works entirely by pattern matching. The body of a macro is just a series of rules:

( pattern1 ) => ( template1 );

( pattern2 ) => ( template2 );

...

Incidentally, you can use square brackets or curly braces instead of parentheses around the pattern or the template; it makes no difference to Rust. Likewise, when you call a macro, these are all equivalent:

assert_eq!(gcd(6, 10), 2);
assert_eq![gcd(6, 10), 2];
assert_eq!{gcd(6, 10), 2}


macro_rules! assert_eq {
   ($left:expr, $right:expr)=>({
      match(&$left,&$right){
           (left_val,right_val) => {
              if!(*left_val == *right_val){
                panic!("assertion failed")
              }
           }
      }
   });
}

gcd(6, 10), 2);

gcd(6,10) - $left:expr
2         - $right:expr

It’s a common mistake to include the fragment type in the output template: writing $left:expr rather than just $left. 
Rust does not immediately detect this kind of error. It sees $left as a substitution, 
and then it treats :expr just like everything else in the template: tokens to be included in the macro’s output. 
So the errors won’t happen until you call the macro; then it will generate bogus output that won’t compile.

Unintended Consequences:-
-------------------------

First, why does this macro create the variables left_val and right_val? 
Is there some reason we can’t simplify the template to look like this?

if !($left == $right) {
    panic!("assertion failed: `(left == right)` \
            (left: `{:?}`, right: `{:?}`)", $left, $right)
}

To answer this question, try mentally expanding the macro call assert_eq!(letters.pop(), Some('z')). 
What would the output be? Naturally, Rust would plug the matched expressions into the template in multiple places. 
It seems like a bad idea to evaluate the expressions all over again when building the error message, though, 
and not just because it would take twice as long: since letters.pop() removes a value from a vector, 
it’ll produce a different value the second time we call it! 
That’s why the real macro computes $left and $right only once and stores their values.

Moving on to the second question: why does this macro borrow references to the values of $left and $right? 
Why not just store the values in variables, like this?

macro_rules! bad_assert_eq {
    ($left:expr, $right:expr) => ({
        match ($left, $right) {
            (left_val, right_val) => {
                if !(left_val == right_val) {
                    panic!("assertion failed" /* ... */);
                }
            }
        }
 });
}
