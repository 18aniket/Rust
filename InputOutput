Rust’s standard library features for input and output are organized around three traits, Read, BufRead, and Write:

Values that implement Read have methods for byte-oriented input. They’re called readers.

Values that implement BufRead are buffered readers. They support all the methods of Read, plus methods for reading lines of text and so forth.

Values that implement Write support both byte-oriented and UTF-8 text output. They’re called writers
