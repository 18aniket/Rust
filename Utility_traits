Language extension traits:
--------------------------
These include Drop, Deref and DerefMut, and the conversion traits From and Into. 


Marker traits:
--------------
These are traits mostly used to bound generic type variables to express constraints you can’t capture otherwise. 
These include Sized and Copy.


Public vocabulary traits:
-------------------------
These don’t have any magical compiler integration; you could define equivalent traits in your own code. 
But they serve the important goal of setting down conventional solutions for common problems. 

These are especially valuable in public interfaces between crates and modules: by reducing needless variation, 
they make interfaces easier to understand, but they also increase the likelihood that features from different crates can simply be plugged together directly, 
without boilerplate or custom glue code.

These include Default, the reference-borrowing traits AsRef, AsMut, Borrow and BorrowMut; 
the fallible conversion traits TryFrom and TryInto; and the ToOwned trait, a generalization of Clone.

Trait	  Description
Drop	- Destructors. Cleanup code that Rust runs automatically whenever a value is dropped.
Sized	- Marker trait for types with a fixed size known at compile time, as opposed to types (such as slices) that are dynamically sized.
Clone	- Types that support cloning values.
Copy	- Marker trait for types that can be cloned simply by making a byte-for-byte copy of the memory containing the value.
Deref and DerefMut	- Traits for smart pointer types.
Default	- Types that have a sensible “default value.”
AsRef and AsMut	- Conversion traits for borrowing one type of reference from another.
Borrow and BorrowMut	- Conversion traits, like AsRef/AsMut, but additionally guaranteeing consistent hashing, ordering, and equality.
From and Into	- Conversion traits for transforming one type of value into another.
TryFrom and TryInto	- Conversion traits for transforming one type of value into another, for transformations that might fail.
ToOwned	- Conversion trait for converting a reference to an owned value.
