Fixed-width numeric types can overflow or lose precision, but they are adequate for most applications and can be thousands of times faster than representations like arbitrary-precision integers and exact rationals.
If you need those sorts of numeric representations, they are supported in the "num" crate.


Size (bits)	Unsigned integer	Signed integer	Floating-point
  8	              u8	              i8	 
  16	            u16	              i16	 
  32	            u32	              i32	        f32
  64	            u64	              i64	        f64
  128	            u128	            i128	 
Machine word	    usize	            isize	 

Here, a machine word is a value the size of an address on the machine the code runs on, 32 or 64 bits.
