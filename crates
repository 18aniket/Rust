Once it has the source code, Cargo compiles all the crates. It runs rustc, the Rust compiler, once for each crate in the projectâ€™s dependency graph. When compiling libraries, Cargo uses the --crate-type lib option. This tells rustc not to look for a main() function but instead to produce an .rlib file containing compiled code that can be used to create binaries and other .rlib files.

When compiling a program, Cargo uses --crate-type bin, and the result is a binary executable for the target platform.
