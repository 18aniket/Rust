Tragically, not every program in the world is written in Rust. 
There are many critical libraries and interfaces implemented in other languages that 
we would like to be able to use in our Rust programs.

Rust’s foreign function interface (FFI) lets Rust code call functions written in C, 
and in some cases C++. 
Since most operating systems offer C interfaces, Rust’s foreign function interface allows 
immediate access to all sorts of low-level facilities.
